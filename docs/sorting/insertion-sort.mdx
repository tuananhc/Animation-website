# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one item at a time.  
It is similar to the way people often sort playing cards in their hands:  
you take one card at a time and insert it into the correct position among the already sorted cards.

## Steps

1. Start from the second element (the first element is already considered sorted).
2. Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted portion.
3. Shift elements in the sorted portion one position to the right until the correct location for the current element is found.
4. Insert the current element at that position.
5. Repeat until all elements are sorted.

## Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Worst case: \(O(n^2)\)  
  - Best case: \(O(n)\) (when the list is already sorted)  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (in-place sorting)  
- **Stable**: Yes (keeps equal elements in the same relative order).  
- **Adaptive**: Performs better if the list is partially sorted.

    ## Python Example

    ```python
    def insertion_sort(arr):
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            key = arr[i]   # The element to insert
            j = i - 1
            
            # Move elements greater than key to one position ahead
            while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
            
            # Insert the key into the correct location
            arr[j + 1] = key
        
        return arr
    ```
